        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Justin and this is my bio page. I was born and raised
            in Detroit, MI. I have a BS in Industrial Engineer from Purdue University which
            brought me to the Pacific NW, where I currently reside. I love food! So enjoying
            the variety Portland has to offer when ever I can <a href="//screendoorrestaurant.com"></a> is one of my favorites.
            I generally enjoy all things Sci-fi and especially enjoy comics. The X-men are my all time favorite, check them out here -
            <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men"></a> Currently, I am learning to become a Full Stack Python Developer.
